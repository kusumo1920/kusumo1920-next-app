            My full name is <strong>Kesit Budi Kusumo</strong>. At the moment, I
            work as an Indonesian software engineer remotely in an awesome
            company - <em>Solecode</em>. There I and teams build many beautiful,
            useful, and great products (so called apps ðŸ˜‰). Mostly, those apps
            are content & data oriented: managing (create, update, delete),
            displaying, and plotting data.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my free time, besides doing freelance and spend with family, I
            also always try to re-update and getting new IT knowledge. Whether
            its new concepts or open source tools, they always make me excited
            (It&apos;s awesome right, we&apos;re lucky to live in the era of
            growing open source).
          </p>
          <p>
            I think that&apos;s all I can share about me, interested in other
            that maybe I miss something? Then please contact me via the top
            navigation link above.
